Project Overview:

This project created for the position Chiril Grituc android developer, by Chiril Grituc, built with the open API provided by CodeWars in [CodeWars API Documentation](https://dev.codewars.com/), for the position #2 on the leaderboard - jhoffner. It follows the MVVM architecture and adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture. The app leverages Jetpack Compose with Material3 design for a modern and responsive UI. Dependency injection is handled with Dagger/Hilt, and coroutines are used for asynchronous operations. The project includes robust loading state handling to ensure a smooth user experience during data fetching. A local Room database is used to cache data for offline access, and a network checker is implemented to avoid unnecessary network requests when the internet is unavailable.
